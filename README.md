<h1 align='center'> Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Abraham</h1>
<h3 align='center'>Web Developer</h3>

<h2>I Am Interested In: 

- Web Development
- Security
- DevOps
- Augmented Reality
- Iâ€™m currently learning the MERN stack and creating single page applications.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any open source projects dealing with React or Java.

  <p>You can find some of the projects I worked on during my time in University.  
  You can also find the projects I have been working on in the meantime.

  I am constantly pushing myself to learn and keep up with the latest technologies.  
  You may find that some of the projects are not working at all times, 
  and this may be because I am currently making changes to it.  
  I hope I can contribute to a project that will reach many people and I hope 
  to continue to grow and expand my understanding and skill-set. </p>
